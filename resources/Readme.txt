This software is a very simple, easy to use IP to IP messaging program. It delivers text messages from one to another computer (and reverse) through the UDP protocol. You only need the IP address of your computer and the computer to whom you want to talk, that’s all.

User can chat only one person at a given time. To chat with a person, connect with him/her by clicking on the Connect button or pressing Altr + C on the keyboard. A dialog box will come asking you for an IP address to whom you want to talk. Enter the IP address and click on OK.

A copy of this software should be running to that person's computer. It will tell him/her what the IP address of that machine is. Obtain that address and use that to connect with him/her. A dialog box will appear asking him/her that you are trying for a connection. If he/she agrees, both of you will be connected with each other. Then type anything in the text typer box and hit Enter (or click on Send Message button). The message will be transferred to remotely connected machine and he/she can see that.

Very Simple Messenger is a good choice if a secure communication environment is required. This program contains 128 bit strength cipher by which you can encrypt your text messages before sending over the network. The remote machine will automatically detect the encryption and decrypt that. To enable encryption and ensure secure communication, turn on "Encrypt text message before sending" in the "Data Security" tab of the Options dialog box (hit F2).

To obtain your IP address, go to Program | My Address or hit F3.

To make the end of the messaging session, press Disconnect button or hit Altr + D. You can get full about other keyboard shortcuts in the Help | Keyboard Shortcuts menu.
